Turn orders   <br> please also refer to the stats menu from top to bottom. <br> Germany/Poland/Finland/Russia/Romania/France/Italy/UK/Spain/Greece/Turkey/U.S <br><br>   <br>  ===============Notable Changes============  <br><br>  ->-previous unfavorable units (especially for experienced players) have better  <br>  cost-effectiveless, detail please see below units chart); <br><br> ->-battleship/cruiser are more powerful and expensive to reflect their capital  <br> ship status, and the effectiveness of carrier + airforce, subs. <br><br>  ->-Mot.Inf, Mech.Inf, Tankette better balanced for their attack/def/range/cost <br> <br>  ->-Heavyarmour is now 4+1/5/2/8 with artillery ablility, so it has close cost/ <br> effectiveness as 2 artilleries @ 4+1+1/2+2/1/4+4, +1 range v.s +1 hit. <br><br>  ->-Earlyfighter is now no more preferable than fighter and should be phased out <br>  as game progress, though they are still good in closer range combat; <br><br> ->-Much stronger French/Polish positioning; slightly delayed Russian expansion <br> expansion; higher American income but later war involvement; higher intial UK <br> income; stronger allied naval strengthstrength; stronger Italian naval attack/ <br> defensive capacity, but less transports capacity, weaker Italian land strength. <br><br>  ->-significantly better quality German intial army; stronger Finns; <br><br> ->-Greece, Spain, Turkey as buffer states for both sides. 3 German generals; <br><br>  ->-French/ColonialFrench are now combined into France as a single nation, both  <br> Paris and S.Canada are French capitals. If paris fall, France would still lose <br> PUs, but would be able to regenerate PUs later from second capital. Therefore <br> a liberated France would be much stronger if Axis ever let it happen.  <br><br>  ->- Changed turn order, moved up France and Finns, important!!! please refer to stat. <br><br> ->-Ankara CAN  be reached from sz 52!  <br>  ->-Axis is no longer able to build factories. Factory price gone up to 20 PUs.  <br>   <br><br>   ==========Recommended house rules========= <br><br> ->- special units, are now triggered and will be available from round 4 and up  <br> ->- no stacking of bunkers, the rule is 1 bunker 1 terrory per turn.  <br> the game should be more balanced.   <br><br>      <br>     <table border="0"bgcolor="444444">     <tr>     <th

the key is a Blitz to quckly <br> knock out France and Poland out of war, securing Westernflank, and consolidate </td> along Ukraine -Estonia line; saving core German strength and once a critical <br> mass is obtained, penetrate Red army defense into Russian heartland... </td> in the Southern theater, Italian expansion may be realized if German/Turkey can  <br> drain sufficient British resources, Spain has to hold American long enough.; <br> Atlantic Theater, over spending on German navy(they are very expensive) is not  <br> recommended as they are no match to a combined Allied naval presence, while  <br> giving room for Russian build up. Try regroup Uboat fleet to safety and rejoin  <br> the rest of Baltic fleet.  <br> Minor Axis needs to survive and divert enough Allied attention.  <br><br><br> Allied strategy is more straight forward, as they generally react to Axis moves <br> until regainning initiative; a Strong Russia is the key for Allied victory.  <br> British now has a harder choice to make, either to reinforce Greece or France. <br> A good French strategy could delay/if not prevent the inevitable German march <br> on Paris, hammper Italian ambitions in Mediterranean or help strengthen UK navy. <br> A Polish defeat is certainty, player needs to weigh the benefit and cost of stay <br> and fight, hoping to inflict enough damage to Germans, or join the Russians. <br> American still faces the two choices of Atlantic or Med     For more Triplea maps please visit :<br>     http://enclavesaga.googlepages.com/<br><br><br>       <br> <br> <br>Changelog version 2.0.3 by ice <br> <br>Changed some more unit looks and stats <br>added general and mobile factory to build <br>fixed bunker placement <br>fixed some errors in the gamenotes <br>fixed ankara sz 52 connection <br>fixed some flags that where still ugly <br>deleted some factorys in russia and germany <br>added 2 mobile factorys in russia <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Changelog version 2.0.1 by ice <br> <br>Added relief tiles from seig <br>Upgraded unit appearances,directions and colors <br>changed some unit stats and cost <br>few changes to production <br>updated gamenotes <br>fixed some flags <br>canarians to spain, belorussia to poland <br>Goal was to keep as close to the original  <br> <br>For bugs,ideas or suggestions use the developper forum <br> <br> ------------------ original map baseframe credit to Seig NWO1939-------------.      </body>     </html>
